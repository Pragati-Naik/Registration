Here are the steps to run my code:

for sql:
1. create database reg
2. create table Registration with required columns

for crud operations i have used Python and editor is VSCODE:
1. Firstly, should make connections by importing mysql connector and write all the credentials required to connect the database. Since we have to do crud operations.
2. Registr.py has the code for crud opertaions
3. Run the code, On vscode terminal It will print "Record inserted successfully" and if any error it will display the errror.
4. then check database for the entries.
